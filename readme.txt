== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? = Yes, you need a POWr Account.  Your account allows you to edit plugins right in your live webpage, and to recreate plugins across many different sites.

= How do I add Map to a page or blog post? = Add the shortcode **[powr-map label='Enter any label here']** to any page or post. Then visit your live site to edit.

= Can I add more than one Map? = Yes, absolutely!  To clone your Map, just add the exact same shortcode to pages or posts.  To create a new version of Map, add a different shortcode to each page or post, for example: **[powr-map label='first form']**, and **[powr-map label='second form']**.

= Will my users see the settings icon in the corner of the Map? = No! You only see the settings icon because you own the plugins. To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow' (the letter p followed by the down arrow). You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.

= I can't see the settings icon anymore, what happened? = You are just logged out of POWr.io. You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.

= Is POWr Map Free? = Yes, the basic version of Map is completely free!

= Why should I upgrade? = Upgrading gives you access to advanced features, removes all POWr watermarks, speeds up widget loading speed, gets you premium support, and supports the creation of more great plugins!
